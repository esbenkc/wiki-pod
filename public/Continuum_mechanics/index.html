    <h1>Continuum Mechanics</h1>
    <p>
      Continuum mechanics is a subfield of physics that focusses on the behavior
      of materials seen as continuous, non-discrete media. The concept
      originated from French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy in the 19th
      century. This form of mechanics primarily handles deformable as opposed to
      rigid bodies, assuming that the content of the object entirely fills the
      space it occupies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This concept discounts the atomic makeup of matter, providing an accurate
      representation of material behavior at lengths substantially larger than
      inter-atomic distances. It utilizes differential equations to predict
      matter behavior based on physical laws like conservation of mass,
      momentum, and energy. The specific substance details are highlighted in
      constitutive relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuum mechanics handle the physical properties of solids and fluids
      without associating them with specific coordinate systems. This property
      is characterized using tensors, independent mathematical objects free of
      coordinate systems, allowing property definition at any apparant point in
      the continuum. The theories of elasticity, plasticity, and fluid mechanics
      are based on these concepts.
    </p>
    <h2>Concept of a Continuum</h2>
    <p>
      A continuum forms the basis of the mathematical framework used to study
      large-scale forces and deformations in materials. Despite the discrete
      molecular structure of matter, physical phenomena can often be modeled by
      viewing a substance as distributed throughout a region of space. A
      continuum is a body that can be indefinitely divided into infinitesimal
      elements with local material properties defined at specific points.
      Material properties can be described by continuous functions, and their
      progression is studied using calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common assumptions in continuum mechanics study are homogeneity (identical
      properties in all locations) and isotropy (directionally invariant vector
      properties). Typically, these assumptions are applied to specific sections
      of the material where they hold to simplify the analysis. For more
      complicated cases, one or both assumptions might be dropped, and
      computational methods are then employed to solve the differential
      equations that describe the evolution of material properties.
    </p>
    <h2>Major Areas in Continuum Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Continuum mechanics: Studying the physics of continuous materials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Solid mechanics: Examining the physics of continuous materials that
        maintain their rest shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Elasticity: Studying materials that resume their original shape after
        the removal of applied force.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plasticity: Investigating materials that permanently distort after an
        applied stress is exerted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rheology: The study of properties exhibited by materials that show
        characteristics of both solids and fluids.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fluid mechanics: Probing into the physics of continuous materials that
        deform when a force is applied.
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-Newtonian and Newtonian fluids: Research on fluids that undergo
        strain rates proportional and disproportional to the amount of shear
        stress applied.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One distinct area covers elastomeric foams that display a hyperbolic
      stress-strain relationship. Though these are considered a continuum, the
      homogeneous distribution of voids gives it uniquely distinct properties.
    </p>
    <h2>Formulation of Models</h2>
    <p>
      Models in continuum mechanics are formulated by assigning a
      three-dimensional Euclidean space to the material body under scrutiny.
      Different body configurations or states correspond to different regions in
      this space. Physical properties of the body at any given time are denoted
      by parameters that define the model, and these properties must align with
      physical norms - they must be continuous, globally invertible,
      orientation-preserving, and twice continuously differentiable.
    </p>
    <h2>Forces in a Continuum</h2>
    <p>
      Investigating forces in a continuum is another crucial aspect of continuum
      mechanics. This typically necessitates a detailed understanding of the
      material's mechanical behavior and the forces that impact it. The effects
      of these forces are often measured and quantified using advanced
      mathematical models and experimental data.
