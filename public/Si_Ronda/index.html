    </div><h1>Si Ronda</h1>
<p>Si Ronda is a 1930 silent film from the Dutch East Indies. The film was directed by Lie Tek Swie and starred Bachtiar Effendi. Based on Betawi oral tradition, the film tells the story of Si Ronda, a bandit skilled in silat (traditional Malay martial arts). Si Ronda is often portrayed as a Robin Hood figure, taking from the rich to give to the poor. The film did not receive much coverage in the media upon its release. A remake titled Si Ronda Macan Betawi was made in 1978.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>The film was adapted from a lenong, a Betawi oral tradition similar to a stage play, popular among ethnic Chinese and native audiences at the time. The story is about a bandit skilled in silat who steals from the rich to give to the poor. According to Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran, the story was chosen for adaptation due to its potential action sequences.  </p>
<p>Si Ronda was directed by Lie Tek Swie and produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of Tan's Film. Cinematography was led by A. Loepias. Bachtiar Effendi, a set decorator with Tan's, played the title role in his film debut. The film also features actor Momo.</p>
<h2>Release and Legacy</h2>
<p>Si Ronda was released in 1930. Dutch newspapers reported that it had screened in Medan, North Sumatra, by 1932. After Si Ronda, Lie and Tan collaborated on three more films before Lie left Tan's in 1932. Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, and Momo continued acting until 1941. The film is now thought to be lost.</p>
<p>Another film based on the Ronda stories, Si Ronda Macan Betawi, was released in 1978. This film adaptation shows Ronda using his silat skills to fight against corrupt landowners and colonial government workers.
