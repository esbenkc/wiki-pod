    </div><h1>General Relativity</h1>
<p>General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity and Einstein's theory of gravity, is a geometric theory of gravitation that was published by Albert Einstein. It's a broad description of gravity as a geometric attribute of space and time, also referred to as four-dimensional spacetime.</p>
<p>The theory provides a unified explanation of gravity, generalizing special relativity and refining Newton's law of universal gravitation. According to general relativity, the energy and momentum of matter and radiation are directly related to the curvature of spacetime, a relationship specified by the Einstein field equations.</p>
<p>While Newton's law describes gravity for almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions, general relativity makes predictions beyond Newton's law, addressing the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Thus far, all tests have confirmed the predictions of general relativity.</p>
<p>In cosmology, the time-dependent solutions of general relativity have enabled us to discuss the history of the universe and have provided the framework for understanding the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation. However, reconciling general relativity with the laws of quantum physics remains a challenge. </p>
<p>Astrophysically, Einstein's theory has significant implications, including the prediction of black holes—spaces in which spacetime is so distorted that nothing can escape from them, including light. Further predictions include the existence of gravitational waves and gravitational lensing—the bending of light resulting in multiple images of the same distant astronomical object.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The development of general relativity began with Einstein's concept of gravity being incorporated into his existing relativistic framework. After a series of setbacks and detours, his work eventually led to the presentation of the Einstein field equations, forming the base of his general theory of relativity. </p>
<p>Einstein's theory was superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and explaining several effects that the Newtonian theory could not. However, it wasn't until the 1960s and 70s, a period known as the golden age of general relativity, that the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics. Today, general relativity is recognized for its beauty and simplicity and is often described as one of the most beautiful physical theories in existence.</p>
<h2>From Classical Mechanics to General Relativity</h2>
<p>General relativity can be understood by drawing comparisons with and distinguishing from classical physics. Conceptually, it postulates that there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion influenced by gravitational force, leading to a new class of inertial motion—that of objects in free fall under gravity's influence. This suggests a new geometry of space and time. This leap, from Newton's classical mechanics to Einstein's relativity, triggers a fundamental shift in our understanding of gravity.</p>
<h2>Einstein's Equations</h2>
<p>General relativity's fundamental equations, known as Einstein's field equations, describe how the geometry of space and time is influenced by matter and radiation. The equations are a divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor and the metric. The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and have been leveraged to derive many important results and consequences in the field of modern physics. </p>
<p>The theory depicts a key concept that the world line of a particle that is free from all external, non-gravitational force is a particular type of geodesic in curved spacetime. In simpler words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.</p>
<p>Despite the inherent complexity and rich mathematical structure, general relativity has been extraordinarily successful in providing insight into many phenomena in a wide range of physics, from cosmological scales to experiences in our everyday lives.
